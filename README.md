# Cross-Labs-Summer-2024
Code used in Cross Labs Summer 2024 Internship

These folders are the code that I used during my internship this summer.

BrainFlow is a library for interfacing with biosensors and processing biosensor data. 
I used it with Python and the OpenBCI Ultracortex Mark IV.
The code is all samples pulled from the BrainFlow Documentation.

TSception is an AI model to detect Arousal based on EEG data.
I followed the instructions from their GitHub page and trained the AI model.
I then implemented the model to test the sample data in Use.py.
